# Application is under development 

I was looking for an example for my portfolio and selected a task from a Telegram Contest.

This is a javascript application that shows graphs.

It is currently under development, but some functions can be viewed at https://pure-code.ru/chart-app/ or run on a local server:

1: ```npm install``` <br>
2: ```npm start``` <br>
3: go to ```http://localhost:8080/```
